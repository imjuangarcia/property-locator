# Property Locator

A tool that takes data from multiple real state sites in Argentina, scraping the information [with this code](https://github.com/imjuangarcia/property-scraper), and add filtering and sorting functionalities.

Heads up that I don't use this tool anymore, since I've moved a while back. This repo isn't maintained anymore, and since it was last used, the markup from the real state sites might've changed. Feel free to give it a try and update if necessary!

## Installation and running the app

1. `git clone https://github.com/imjuangarcia/property-locator/`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
